<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

NotificationService aims to be a plugin that will simplify the process of adding Notifications within your Xamarin app. 
Simply call a single function, and let the plugin work out the rest under the hood. 

THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH IN ALPHA. However, please expect more in the future.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
TBC
WIll put notes here for the following

A) Allowing iOS to show notifications to User while app is still open.
B) Inform users concerning android notification channels
C) inform users concerning some "boiler plate" with android and sounds and whatnot.
D) Discuss Android Doze.
E) Discuss benefits and drawbacks of using Android AlarmManager for Scheduled Alarms (Cuts through android doze, 1 every 15 minutes though)
